# Detecting Nike type of sneakers shoes

Computer vision for detecting type of sneakers shoes (only trained for brand Nike)




**Aim of this project :**

As a sneakers addict, it is really easy for me to guess the type of shoes I am looking.
But for instance, when I show picture to my relatives they cannot differentiate dunk with jordan.
  
Therefore my project aim to tell you what type of shoes it is by giving him  a picture in input.

Here a concrete example :  

You choose this picture:

<img src="https://github.com/axelooc59/Detecting-type-of-sneakers-shoes/blob/main/mocha.png" alt="drawing" width="200"/>

It will return his types which is *Jordan 1 High*.
