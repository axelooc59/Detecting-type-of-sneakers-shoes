# Detecting Nike type of sneakers shoes

Computer vision for detecting type of sneakers shoes (only trained for brand Nike)




**Aim of this project :**

As a sneakers addict, it is really easy for me to guess the type of shoes I am looking.
But for instance, when I show picture to my relatives they cannot differentiate dunk with jordan.
  
Therefore my project aim to tell you what type of shoes it is by giving him  a picture in input.

Here a concrete example :  

You choose this picture:

<img src="https://github.com/axelooc59/Detecting-type-of-sneakers-shoes/blob/main/mocha.png" alt="drawing" width="200"/>

It will return his types which is *Jordan 1 High*.

My programm will support the following type of shoes:
* Jordan 1 High
* Jordan 1 Mid
* Jordan 1 low
* Jordan 4
* Jordan 3
* Jordan 2
* Dunk low (classic shape)
* Dunk low disrupt 2
* Dunk low disrupt
* Dunk high

As a beginner in machine learning and in order to make this project easier the only accepted picture is like the below one. Namely the shoe is oriented to the left and on a white background.
